# Engineering Science @ UofT - Year 2

## LaTeX styling

I tried using Vim and LaTeX for taking notes this semester (inspired by my housemate [Brian](https://chenbrian.ca/) who uses Vim, and [this article](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)). Huge mistakes LOL. Jk given time I could've gotten more used to it but it was tough, especially math mode and inserting figures quickly.

For the styling, I downloaded the [NotesTeX package](https://ctan.org/pkg/notestex?lang=en). After you download the package, in order to use it in a TeX document, you just need to insert a line near the top of your TeX document:

    \usepackage{PATH TO YOUR PACKAGE LOCATION}
